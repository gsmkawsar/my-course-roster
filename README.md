Question: Add at least 3 Project features?

1 Answer: count is the state variable, and setCount is the function to update it. When the "Increment" or "Decrement" buttons are clicked, the setCount function is called to update the count state, which triggers a re-render of the component with the updated count value.
2 Answer: the useEffect hook is used to initiate a data fetch when the component is mounted (when it first renders). The empty dependency array [] ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render. If you provide dependencies, the effect will run whenever those dependencies change.
3 Answer: we pass both greeting and name as props to the child component, allowing it to compose and display the greeting message dynamically.
